# Proposal Generator & ChatBot

### _By Code Crafters_

The main objective of this project was to provide a platform to generate proposals for software projects based on requirements provided.

This eliminates the process of writing a prompt defining the usecase situation and any other parameters manually everytime in any AI platform to get better results.

We have also added the functionality to store the proposal in PDF, download the PDF and also to send the PDF as an attachment in an email. Making it easier to share the generated proposal.

We have also integrated a chatbot for you to ask any quick questions without switching platforms.
